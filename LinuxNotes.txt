1. Linux - 

    It is an open-source operating system based on Unix principle

    The kernel acts as a bridge between software and hardware.
    It manages hardware resources (like CPU, memory, and devices) and allows software applications to 
    interact with the hardware. 

    Shell is an Command Line interface which allows the User to interact with Kernel. It takes User commands, translates them into
    system calls and communicate with the Kernel to execute them.

    User ( interacts using CLI ) → Shell → Kernel → Hardware

    * User → Shell → Kernel → Hardware

6. Permissions and Ownership -

    Permission format:

    -rwxr--r--
    |   | |  |

    4 - setuid
    2 - setgid
