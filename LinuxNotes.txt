1. Linux - 
    It is an open-source operating system based on Unix principle
    The kernel acts as a bridge between software and hardware.
    It manages hardware resources (like CPU, memory, and devices) and allows software applications to 
    interact with the hardware. 
    shell is an intermediate btw kernel and hardware

    User → Shell → Kernel → Hardware


    ------------   Basic commands   ------------    

1. uname ->  prints the kernel name

2. man <Command> -> manual command gives info about the command passed

3. hostname -> gives hostname

4. whoami-> Who am i - gives information about the current User

5. sudo -> runs command using root User, Root user is the admin user

6. sudo - i -> login the current user as root user

7. tty ->

8. users -> gives info about all the users on this system

9. adduser username -> creates new user 

10. id -> gives information about the user logged in

11. users -> gives information about all the groups, groups refers to say admin group , normal user 
    group etc

12. su -> switch user , switches users

13. usermod -> user modify , modifies users 
    usermod -g group_NewGroup username
    usermod -a (append) -G sudo dummy1  (Gives sudo permission to dummy1 user)

14. addgroup groupName-> creates new group

15. deluser username-> delete the given username

16. delgroup groupName-> deletes the given groupName

17. date -> prints or sets the system date or time

18. echo -> The echo command in Linux is used to display a line of text or a string. It's commonly used 
    to print text to the terminal or to write data to a file
            echo "file content" > filename -> adds content to given filename
            echo "file content" >> filename -> appends content to the given filename

19. passwd -> changes the current password of user

20. pwd -> Shows the current working directory

21. touch filename-> Used to create new file , touch .filename creates a hidden file

22. cd -> change directory , cd .. moves to the parent directory, cd - move to the previous directory

23. head filename -> Shows starting content of file for given number of lines
    head  -10 dummy.txt prints first 10 lines

24. tail filename -> Shows starting content of file for given number of lines
    tail  -10 dummy.txt prints alst 10 lines
    tail -f dummy.txt - shows live changes in a file

25. file -> determines file type

26. sort filename -> sorts the file contents
    to store the sorted content inside another file use sort -o result.txt file1.txt file2.txt

27. cat filename-> concatinates the file and shows on standard output device or terminal
    cat > result.txt -> whatever is written in stored inside result.ṭxt file
    cat result.txt -> reads the content of result.txt file
    > standard output 
    < standard input
    input(0) output(1) error(2)
    
    unknownCommand >> error.txt 2>&1   (append the standard output in error.txt and standard error 
    is redirected to standard output)

    >> appends into the file

28. pipe concept ->output of one command becomes input for another command 
    ls | sort  -> ls output acts as input for sort

29. mkdir directoryName -> make directory
    mkdir -p test1/test2/test3/{folder1,folder2}

30. rmdir directoryName -> removes a directory
    rm -rv directoryName -> removes directory and shows on terminal
